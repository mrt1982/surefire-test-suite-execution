surefire-test-suite-execution
=============================

`maven-surefire-plugin` runs tests that are part of a JUnit test-suite twice. It runs them once as independent tests and
again as part of a suite.

This behaviour seems inconvenient and not easy to circumvent.

This project is an example of such behaviour.
